# Find-S Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Find-S algorithm in Python. The Find-S algorithm is a simple concept learning algorithm used in machine learning to find the most specific hypothesis that fits all positive examples.

## Files

- `find_s_algorithm.py`: Python implementation of the algorithm.
- `enjoysport.csv`: Sample training data (you should add this file with your dataset).
- `README.md`: This file.

## How It Works

The program:
1. Reads training data from a CSV file.
2. Initializes a hypothesis with the most specific values (`0`).
3. Iteratively updates the hypothesis based on positive examples (label = 1).
4. Outputs the hypothesis after each step and finally prints the learned hypothesis.
